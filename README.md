## User Flows

### Wallet Connection Flow

```typescript
// src/contexts/WalletProvider.tsx
export const WalletAdapterProvider = ({ children }: Props) => {
  const endpoint = clusterApiUrl("devnet");
  const wallets = useMemo(() => [], []);
  return (
    <ConnectionProvider endpoint={endpoint}>
      <WalletProvider autoConnect wallets={wallets}>
        <WalletModalProvider>{children}</WalletModalProvider>
      </WalletProvider>
    </ConnectionProvider>
  );
};
```

### AI Processing Flow

```typescript
// src/api/langchain.ts
const IntentSchema = z.object({
  intent: z.enum(['swap', 'checkBalance', 'transfer', 'normalChat', 'unknown']),
  amount: z.number().optional(),
  sourceToken: z.string().optional(),
  destinationToken: z.string().optional(),
  error: z.string().optional(),
  generalResponse: z.string(),
});
```

## API Integrations

### Jupiter Swap Integration

```typescript
// src/api/jupiter-swap-example.ts
const swap = async ({
  inputAmount,
  inputMint,
  outputMint,
  slippageBps = 50,
}: SwapParams): Promise<string> => {
  // ... swap implementation
};
```

### Switchboard Price Feed Integration

```typescript
// src/components/dashboard/switch-board-price-feeds.tsx
const SwitchboardPriceFeed = () => {
  // Fetch and update price feeds
  const fetchPrice = async (symbol: string) => {
    const response = await fetch(
      `https://www.binance.com/api/v3/ticker/price?symbol=${symbol}USDT`
    );
    const data = await response.json();
    // Update price state
  };

  // Wallet-verified on-chain price updates
  const updateFeed = async (feed: SwitchboardFeed) => {
    const updateIx = {
      programId: switchboardProgramId,
      keys: [
        { pubkey: new PublicKey(feed.address), isWritable: true },
        { pubkey: publicKey, isSigner: true, isWritable: true },
      ],
    };
    // Execute transaction
  };
};
```

### LangChain AI Integration

```typescript
const model = new ChatOpenAI({
  model: 'gpt-4o-mini',
  temperature: 0,
  apiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_LANGCHAIN_API_KEY,
});
```

## üéÆ User Guide

### Requirements

Before running NIZO, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v18.0.0 or higher)
- npm (v8.0.0 or higher)

## Interacting with NIZO

NIZO uses a chat interface where you can input natural language commands. Here are some supported operations:

### Token swaps

```
User: "Swap 2 SOL to USDC"
NIZO: "I'll help you swap 2 SOL to USDC. Current rate is [rate]. Would you like to proceed?"
```

### Balance Checks

```
User: "What's my SOL balance?"
NIZO: "Your current SOL balance is [amount] SOL"
```

### Transaction History

```
User: "Show my recent transactions"
NIZO: "Here are your recent transactions: [list of transactions]"
```

### Price Feed Operations

```
User: "What's the current SOL price?"
NIZO: "The current price of SOL is $XX.XX USD. Would you like me to update this price for you?"
User: "Yes, update the price"
NIZO: "I'll update the SOL price feed. Please approve the transaction in your wallet."
```

## Supported Intent Types

Based on the implementation in langchain.ts:

- swap: Token swap operations
- checkBalance: Balance inquiries
- transfer: Token transfers
- normalChat: General inquiries
- unknown: Fallback for unrecognized intents

## üîí Security Measures

### Wallet Security

- Your wallet, your keys: We never store or have access to your wallet's private keys - only you control your funds
- Safe transaction signing: All transactions are signed directly in your browser using your personal wallet (like Phantom or Solflare)
- Reliable connections: We use multiple backup connection points to the Solana network to ensure the app stays working even if one connection fails

```typescript
const FALLBACK_RPCS = [
  'https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_API_KEY',
  'https://try-rpc.mainnet.solana.com',
  // ...
];
```

### Transaction Security

- Price protection: We protect you from unexpected price changes during swaps (maximum price change allowed: 0.5%)
- Safety checks: We test each transaction before executing it to ensure it will work as expected
- Reliable processing: If one connection fails, we automatically try other secure connections
- Error protection: If something goes wrong, we have systems to help recover and fix the issue

```typescript
// Example of transaction security measures
const confirmation = await connection.confirmTransaction(txid, 'confirmed');

if (confirmation.value.err) {
  throw new Error(`Transaction failed: ${confirmation.value.err.toString()}`);
}
```

### Data Privacy

- Secure chat history: Your chat messages are only stored temporarily while you use the app
- No sensitive storage: We never store your private financial information
- Limited local storage: We only save basic information like contact names on your device
- Protected secrets: All sensitive API keys and configurations are securely stored and never exposed to users

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- UI Components: shadcn/ui
- Blockchain: Solana Web3.js
- DEX Aggregator: Jupiter Protocol
- Price Oracle: Switchboard Protocol
- AI Processing: LangChain with GPT-4 Mini
- Wallet: Solana Wallet Adapter

## üìà Performance Considerations

- Quick Response Time: The app shows you immediate feedback for your actions while processing happens in the background, making everything feel faster
- Efficient Chat History: Your chat messages are managed right in your browser, making conversations quick and responsive
- Eye-Friendly Design: Switch between light and dark themes based on your preference to make the app comfortable to use, especially during long sessions

## üîÑ State Management

Messages and chat history are managed through React Context:

```typescript
export function MessageProvider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState<Message[]>([]);
  return (
    <MessageContext.Provider value={{ messages, setMessages }}>
      {children}
    </MessageContext.Provider>
  );
}
```
